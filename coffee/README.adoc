== Build and Run

=== Build

You can build .jar files like so:

```bash
mvn clean package -f scst-source/pom.xml
mvn clean package -f scst-processor/pom.xml
mvn clean package -f scst-/pom.xml
```

=== Run

Due to dependencies on Kafka and RabbitMQ it is
recommended that you use docker-compose to run the
apps:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

It will take a few minutes to start and then you can
view the docker logs to see the coffee get processed:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f source processor sink
```

You should see output that looks like this:

```bash
source_1     | WholesaleCoffee(id=74cceff9-97bd-45aa-8458-76cc00b770c1, name=Kaldi's)
processor_1  | RetailCoffee(id=74cceff9-97bd-45aa-8458-76cc00b770c1, name=Kaldi's, state=WHOLE_BEAN)
sink_1       | RetailCoffee(id=74cceff9-97bd-45aa-8458-76cc00b770c1, name=Kaldi's, state=WHOLE_BEAN)
source_1     | WholesaleCoffee(id=5494c658-f673-4008-8aa0-5cdc77e3ec8a, name=Cereza)
processor_1  | RetailCoffee(id=5494c658-f673-4008-8aa0-5cdc77e3ec8a, name=Cereza, state=WHOLE_BEAN)
sink_1       | RetailCoffee(id=5494c658-f673-4008-8aa0-5cdc77e3ec8a, name=Cereza, state=WHOLE_BEAN)
source_1     | WholesaleCoffee(id=f8850d88-b1ae-40db-b625-3ebb878571a1, name=Sumatra)
processor_1  | RetailCoffee(id=f8850d88-b1ae-40db-b625-3ebb878571a1, name=Sumatra, state=WHOLE_BEAN)
sink_1       | RetailCoffee(id=f8850d88-b1ae-40db-b625-3ebb878571a1, name=Sumatra, state=WHOLE_BEAN)
